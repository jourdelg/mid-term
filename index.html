                   Fear of Difference 
  
                Xenophobia is the fear of anything that is different. It creates hatred and fear and in a lot of cases can be used to 
                manipulate the irrational into making irrational decisions. 
                
                Manipulating people with the use of Xenophobia creates, what we call hate crimes. Propaganda was used commonly to
                promote xenophobia in a time when racism was not only common in the United States, but it was pushed. We saw xenophobia 
                during the chinese exclusion act in the 19th century, in which the United States Prohibited Chinese immigrants from entering
                the country due to them being blamed for why the "Americans" in the labor force had difficulties finding jobs. Xenophobia is
                the direct reason for the holocaust. Fear mongering led hitler to be able to convince an entire nation that another group of people
                who they had lived peacefully with for centuries where the source of the nations problems.
                
                Even today with how progressive we have become and the advancements in psychology, Xenophobia is still a constant recurring problem.
                Hate mongering has led to so many violent hate crimes and with recent events it only seems to be getting worse. Words are a powerful
                weapon to use, and some are easily manipulated. Without thinking a bigot has been voted into power and has essentially become the most 
                powerful person in the world. Abusing the power of hatred and discrimination the people allowed this to happen, due to the their own
                xenophobic ideals. What the future holds is a mystery but we can only hope things improve and people learn to be better people.
